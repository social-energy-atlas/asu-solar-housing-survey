Research Study Description
1-2 paragraphs describing the content (think of it as an abstract). It should include the purpose of the study, as well as the specific research questions or hypotheses that were being investigated by creating the dataset.
The purpose of this study was to examine how rooftop solar PV affected residential real estate transactions in Maricopa County, Arizona. The primary goal was to determine which of three financing arrangements existed at the time the homes were sold. These arrangements included leases with “payments” remaining at the time of sale, “prepaid” solar leases, and “owned” solar PV systems. The hypothesis is that the different kinds of ownership models for solar PV are treated in a measurably different way by the marketplace and this results in different outcomes for those who purchase these homes. Through the questions in the survey we hope to quantitatively and qualitatively measure people’s experiences with pre-existing solar PV in the residential real estate market.
Sampling Frame
Temporal coverage
We sampled solar housing real estate sales where the close of escrow occurred between 01 January, 2014 through 01 July, 2015. Surveys were sent out in August and September of 2015. The second round of duplicate mailings served to remind people who had not already responded to the survey from the first round.
 
Spatial coverage
We sampled households in single-family residential homes in Maricopa County, Arizona. While some areas of Pinal county do fall within the realm of the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale metropolitan statistical area (MSA), as defined by the US Office of Management and Budget, Maricopa County is definitely the “central county” and Pinal would be considered an “outlying county”. Further, the number of potential respondents in the MSA boundaries that overlapped Pinal county was very small, yet more difficult to capture and compare without using geospatial software or datasets to constrain the parameters to MSA boundaries.
Other Parameters for Inclusion
The homes sampled already had solar PV installed at the time of sale. Solar hot water heaters did not qualify. Respondents must have identified themselves as the current homeowner at the time of the survey.  While it might be possible for the mailed survey to be somehow forwarded to a landlord of a rented property, that landlord might not have a keen sense of how the solar has performed over time, nor a close interaction with the solar PV. However, if the solar PV element was a consideration in their purchase of the property, then we would want to hear about that as well. For instance, some landlords make utilities included in their rental agreement, thus might glean some profit by charging a flat monthly electricity fee to their tenants, yet paying less with a solar PV ownership or lease agreement on the property that they own. Some of the homes sampled had only solar hot water heaters but no solar PV. These respondents were excluded from the sample because we were only using solar PV as a technological focal point. Solar hot water heating is a very different technology and includes a very different set of interactions between actors and systems.
Instruments and measures
Protocols for the survey
Description of and details for all questions/fields included in survey (including the exact language presented to respondents)
 
This survey was distributed via US mail. The envelope contained three items. 1) Cover letter. 2) Double-sided survey questionnaire. 3) Metered business return envelope. No postage was necessary for respondent.
 
The questions are listed below, in the order in which they were presented to the respondents. The naming format for these questions (Q1…) was not sequential due to difficulties with the Qualtrics interface but were retained as identifiers anyway in order to maintain consistency between digital and paper responses. These “Q1” indicators were not printed on the survey. The paper version and the online version used the same ordering of questions. We also used skip-check logic that automatically skipped questions for online respondents if they did not apply to them based on their previous answers.
 
See cover letter and Questionnaire documents for exact layout of questionnaire.

Measures
Description of what was being measured in each question, along with the exact language of any fixed responses.
See cover letter and Questionnaire documents for exact language of survey fixed responses.


Survey Question descriptions:
 
Q1 - Unique ID used to track respondents across databases while maintaining anonymity.
 
Q2 - Establishes ownership of home. If yes, response was included. If no, then response was automatically excluded since the recruitment cover letter states that only the homeowner may participate in this survey. All 280 responses were from homeowners. Non-compliant responses for this key question are not included in this data set. 


Q25 - Key question identifies financing model that respondent used to purchase home.
 
Q4 - Establishes the size of the solar PV system for comparison.
 
Q5 - Key question establishes basic financial model for solar PV system.
 
Q6 - Establishes whether respondent inherited payments from previous owner or if the lease was already paid off before final sale of the home.
 
Q7 - Monthly lease payment.
 
Q8 - Identifies solar installer.
 
Q9 - Key question establishes whether seller was required to pay off solar lease before home could be sold.
 
Q10 - Question introduction acts as a primer for memory and context, framing the subject and focusing on the thought process or heuristics that they used when thinking about solar PV on this home and how it might have impacted their decision to purchase the home.
 
This is a matrix of ten questions. The questions were on the Y axis and a modified Likert scale on the X axis.
 
The five Likert scale options include:
Very negative, Somewhat negative, Neutral, Somewhat positive, Very positive
 
The ten questions are classified below: (see questionnaire document for full text)
Q10_1 Environmental - global and conceptual
Q10_2 Environmental - global and conceptual
Q10_3 Environmental - local implication
Q10_4 Financial
Q10_5 Financial
Q10_6 Financial
Q10_7 Social networking interactions
Q10_8 Financial
Q10_9 Financial
Q10_10 Usage preferences, different from grid-tied solar. Sets up thinking for following questions on solar storage.
 
Q18 - Measures familiarity with solar storage technology.
 
Q19 - Measures preferences for different types of usage for solar batteries.
 
Q26 - Measures potential influence of solar batteries on home-buying decisions.
Note: This survey was performed in the year 2015, at a time when solar battery storage was emerging in mass media, but still a fairly new concept to most people. It was also a time just before the now-emerging trend of reducing or eliminating net-metering policies in Arizona and nation-wide.
 
Q20 - Measures potential influence of preferences on choice of whether to purchase solar storage technologies in the future.
 
Q14 - Demographics - gender
 
Q13 - Demographics - age
 
Q17 - Demographics - income
 
Q15 - Demographics - race/ethnicity


Q15_TEXT_Demographics_Race_Ethnicity
This is a field into which people who indicated “other” had the option to enter multiple races or ethnicities. They were recorded here. 
 
Q16 - Demographics - education
 
Q11 - Open essay question - measures expectations vs perceived outcomes
 
Q12 - Open essay question - asks for any information that was not already represented in previous questions but that respondents felt were still important to them in their solar-home buying experience.


Note: The responses to Q11 and Q12 varied widely. While these questions did serve their intended purpose, respondents also included a great deal of comments and information related to things like solar PV markets, environmental preferences, social and policy preferences, among other topics.
 
 
 
Data Description
3-4 paragraphs describing the resulting dataset from the study. This should include a description of the intellectual content, as well as an audit trail of its Q/A process.
 
This survey is important for real estate evaluations because it seeks to create a set of empirical observations about many individual experiences that may not be fully or accurately captured through media reports or inter-personal storytelling. For example, one of the aspects not captured by other pre-existing data sets is the distinction between paid-off solar lease arrangements at the time of sale vs. leases that still had payments remaining. The public narrative treated all leases the same for the purposes of real estate sales (aka: “leased solar vs. owned solar”) but the sub-category of data within leases actually suggests very different outcomes. Potential homebuyers, realtors, assessors, utilities, and policy makers could all benefit from this information.
 
Data collection and data entry:
 
We included a short URL in the cover letter that respondents could enter into their web browser to fill out the survey via our Qualtrics portal. It was mobile friendly. Only a handful of respondents took advantage of this method, even though it also included a QR code that people could access with their mobile devices. The vast majority of respondents chose to return their responses via the paper survey. We then entered this raw information into the Qualtrics web portal manually. Once imported into one database, we performed quality-control which included checking the spelling of solar company names, translation of text into numbers for reported kW size, excluding respondents with solar hot water heaters only, and duplicate responses. The latter two measures accounted for those excluded from the survey.  
 
Notes on Q/A: 
Q19 - Solar storage rankings
One of the solar storage questions was supposed to be a ranked number question. People often answered this question improperly, in part due to the translation from digital to paper. The digital version had logic fail-safes to make sure people answered correctly while the paper version did not. Instead of ranking all three options together with a unique number from 1-3 as instructed, they used it more like a likert scale and ranked each option individually from 1-3. This means that, while still somewhat useful to get a general sense of their preferences, this question (Q19) is neither consistently quantifiable no statistically reliable, due to the high number of non-standard responses. 


Q4 - What is the size of your solar PV system? (in kW)
This question had a lot of quality control applied to it. Respondents often gave answers in what appeared to be watts (W), not kilowatts (kW). Sometimes they indicated that they weren’t sure or gave answers that had to do with some other calculation instead. For those that appeared to simply answer in W instead of kW, we checked the size of the home and panels using Google earth. Where the size of the home and its installed panels appeared to be logical and reasonable, we made the adjustment to comply with kW readings. 


Q8: Solar Installer 
When people indicated their solar installer, sometimes the information was incomplete, incorrectly entered, or simply blank. For the records where we did have responses, we went onto Google to search for each one in order to verify the following information about each installer: a) Correct spelling of company name; b) Solar Installer actually existed and operated within Arizona.This was important because some installer names are quite similar, sometimes only a few characters different. By accurately listing the installers, we may then be able to calculate which companies did the most installations in a particular area. This could then be compared to other demographic data for analysis.

Variable Description
1-2 paragraphs providing all of the information necessary for understanding the variables contained within the data. This should include variable descriptions, as well as permitted values and meaning. You should also provide any context needed for understanding the nature in which it was completed. This should only be a cursory, descriptive analysis of what is in the dataset. We will do a more robust analysis in a resulting whitepaper.
 
The main variables of this study have to do with ownership of the solar panels (Q5) and financing models at the time of home sale (Q6). They can be plainly described by the following:


Two types of solar ownership (Q5):
a) Leased solar 
b) Owned solar


Three types of solar financing models (Q6):
a) Took over payments on the lease
        (zero-down, or partial down. Owned & managed by a 3rd party)
b) Lease was pre-paid
        (lease is payed 100% but still owned & managed by a 3rd party)
c) N/A - system is owned
        (cash or financed so homeowner owns & manages solar installation)


The other questions on the first part of the survey establish who installed the solar (Q8), how much the homeowner pays on a lease if anything (Q6, Q7), and whether or not a pre-paid lease was a stipulation before the sale of the home could occur (Q9). The matrix of questions in Q10 have to do with the homeowner’s attitudes and beliefs that may have influenced their decision to purchase the home, in terms of solar PV. The next set of questions (Q18, Q19, Q26, Q20) have to do with measuring the homeowner’s familiarity with and willingness to potentially adopt solar battery technologies. The demographic questions ask about the respondent’s gender (Q14), age (Q13), household income (Q17), race/ethnicity (Q15), and education (Q16). The final two questions are open-ended questions where respondents can tell us their stories in short essay format (Q11, Q12). 


Other fields included for organization and analysis:


new_primary_key
This is the primary key through which this data may be related to other data sets. It replaces the Q1 Unique ID and is also populated with a random number set.  


Misc. Comments
Comments about nonstandard responses. For instance, sometimes people wrote comments or expanded on answers in the margins of the survey. If there was not already a set field for this kind of information, it was recorded in this field. 


Zip_code
This is the zip code in which the home is located. 


Q17 Income Range Holder
This is a quantitative field that represents the textual range which people chose. For instance, “<$20,000” = 10 in this numbered field. “$20,000-$30,000” = 20. “$30,000-$40,000” = 30, etc… It exists only for simplicity in being able to search for and quantify the results for this variable. 


Q15_TEXT_Demographics_Race_Ethnicity
This is a field into which people who indicated “other” had the option to enter multiple races or ethnicities.
