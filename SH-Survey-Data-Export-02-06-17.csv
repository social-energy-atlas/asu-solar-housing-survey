","Considering that the solar lease was paid in full for another 10 years when I bought this home, this worked out to be a perfect situation to receive ""free power"" for a decade. However, from my research on solar lease prices vs. cost offset (cost/benefit), I probably would have been less inclined to buy this house if I was required to make monthly lease payments. This would have been ESPECIALLY (emphasis added by respondent) true if I was also required to pay SRP's $50/month fee (which I'm not because the system was installed before 12/31/14).
