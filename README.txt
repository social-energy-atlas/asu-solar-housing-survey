Research Study Description
The purpose of this study was to examine how rooftop solar PV affected residential real estate transactions in Maricopa County, Arizona. The primary goal was to determine which of three financing arrangements existed at the time the homes were sold. These arrangements included leases with “payments” remaining at the time of sale, “prepaid” solar leases, and “owned” solar PV systems. The hypothesis is that the different kinds of ownership models for solar PV are treated in a measurably different way by the marketplace and this results in different outcomes for those who purchase these homes. Through the questions in the survey we hope to quantitatively and qualitatively measure people’s experiences with pre-existing solar PV in the residential real estate market.

Sampling Frame

Temporal coverage
We sampled solar housing real estate sales where the close of escrow occurred between 01 January, 2014 through 01 July, 2015. Surveys were sent out in August and September of 2015. The second round of duplicate mailings served to remind people who had not already responded to the survey from the first round.
 
Spatial coverage
We sampled households in single-family residential homes in Maricopa County, Arizona. While some areas of Pinal County do fall within the realm of the Phoenix-Mesa-Scottsdale metropolitan statistical area (MSA), as defined by the US Office of Management and Budget, Maricopa County is definitely the “central county” and Pinal would be considered an “outlying county”. Further, the number of potential respondents in the MSA boundaries that overlapped Pinal County was very small, yet more difficult to capture and compare without using geospatial software or datasets to constrain the parameters to MSA boundaries.

Other Parameters for Inclusion
The homes sampled already had solar PV installed at the time of sale. Solar hot water heaters did not qualify. Respondents must have identified themselves as the current homeowner at the time of the survey.  While it might be possible for the mailed survey to be somehow forwarded to a landlord of a rented property, that landlord might not have a keen sense of how the solar has performed over time, nor a close interaction with the solar PV. However, if the solar PV element was a consideration in their purchase of the property, then we would want to hear about that as well. For instance, some landlords make utilities included in their rental agreement, thus might glean some profit by charging a flat monthly electricity fee to their tenants, yet paying less with a solar PV ownership or lease agreement on the property that they own. Some of the homes sampled had only solar hot water heaters but no solar PV. These respondents were excluded from the sample because we were only using solar PV as a technological focal point. Solar hot water heating is a very different technology and includes a very different set of interactions between actors and systems.
Instruments and measures

Protocols for the survey

This survey was distributed via US mail. The envelope contained three items. 1) Cover letter. 2) Double-sided survey questionnaire. 3) Metered business return envelope. No postage was necessary for respondent.
 
The questions are listed below, in the order in which they were presented to the respondents. The naming format for these questions (Q1…) was not sequential due to difficulties with the Qualtrics interface but were retained as identifiers anyway in order to maintain consistency between digital and paper responses. These “Q1” indicators were not printed on the survey. The paper version and the online version used the same ordering of questions. We also used skip-check logic that automatically skipped questions for online respondents if they did not apply to them based on their previous answers.

Measures
See cover letter and Questionnaire documents for exact language of survey fixed responses.

Survey Question descriptions:
 
Q1 - Unique ID used to track respondents across databases while maintaining anonymity.
 
Q2 - Establishes ownership of home. If yes, response was included. If no, then response was automatically excluded since the recruitment cover letter states that only the homeowner may participate in this survey. All 280 responses were from homeowners. Non-compliant responses for this key question are not included in this data set. 

Q25 - Key question identifies financing model that respondent used to purchase home.
 
Q4 - Establishes the size of the solar PV system for comparison.
 
Q5 - Key question establishes basic financial model for solar PV system.
 
Q6 - Establishes whether respondent inherited payments from previous owner or if the lease was already paid off before final sale of the home.
 
Q7 - Monthly lease payment.
 
Q8 - Identifies solar installer.
 
Q9 - Key question establishes whether seller was required to pay off solar lease before home could be sold.
 
Q10 - Question introduction acts as a primer for memory and context, framing the subject and focusing on the thought process or heuristics that they used when thinking about solar PV on this home and how it might have impacted their decision to purchase the home.
 
This is a matrix of ten questions. The questions were on the Y axis and a modified Likert scale on the X axis.
 
The five Likert scale options include:
Very negative, Somewhat negative, Neutral, Somewhat positive, Very positive
 
The ten questions are classified below: (see questionnaire document for full text)
Q10_1 Environmental - global and conceptual
Q10_2 Environmental - global and conceptual
Q10_3 Environmental - local implication
Q10_4 Financial
Q10_5 Financial
Q10_6 Financial
Q10_7 Social networking interactions
Q10_8 Financial
Q10_9 Financial
Q10_10 Usage preferences, different from grid-tied solar. Sets up thinking for following questions on solar storage.
 
Q18 - Measures familiarity with solar storage technology.
 
Q19 - Measures preferences for different types of usage for solar batteries.
 
Q26 - Measures potential influence of solar batteries on home-buying decisions.
Note: This survey was performed in the year 2015, at a time when solar battery storage was emerging in mass media, but still a fairly new concept to most people. It was also a time just before the now-emerging trend of reducing or eliminating net-metering policies in Arizona and nation-wide.
 
Q20 - Measures potential influence of preferences on choice of whether to purchase solar storage technologies in the future.
 
Q14 - Demographics - gender
 
Q13 - Demographics - age
 
Q17 - Demographics - income
 
Q15 - Demographics - race/ethnicity

Q15_Other_TEXT_Demographics_Race_Ethnicity
This is a field into which people who indicated “other” had the option to enter multiple races or ethnicities. They were recorded here. 
 
Q16 - Demographics - education
 
Q11 - Open essay question - measures expectations vs perceived outcomes
 
Q12 - Open essay question - asks for any information that was not already represented in previous questions but that respondents felt were still important to them in their solar-home buying experience.

Note: The responses to Q11 and Q12 varied widely. While these questions did serve their intended purpose, respondents also included a great deal of comments and information related to things like solar PV markets, environmental preferences, social and policy preferences, among other topics.
 
Data Description

This survey is important for real estate evaluations because it seeks to create a set of empirical observations about many individual experiences that may not be fully or accurately captured through media reports or inter-personal storytelling. For example, one of the aspects not captured by other pre-existing data sets is the distinction between paid-off solar lease arrangements at the time of sale and leases that still had payments remaining. The public narrative treated all leases the same for the purposes of real estate sales (aka: “leased solar vs. owned solar”) but the sub-category of data within leases actually suggests very different outcomes. Potential homebuyers, realtors, assessors, utilities, and policy makers could all benefit from this information.
 
Data collection and data entry:
 
We included a short URL in the cover letter that respondents could enter into their web browser to fill out the survey via our Qualtrics portal. It was mobile friendly. Only a handful of respondents took advantage of this method, even though it also included a QR code that people could access with their mobile devices. The vast majority of respondents chose to return their responses via the paper survey. We then entered this raw information into the Qualtrics web portal manually. Once imported into one database, we performed quality-control which included checking the spelling of solar company names, translation of text into numbers for reported kW size, excluding respondents with solar hot water heaters only, and duplicate responses. The latter two measures accounted for those excluded from the survey.  
 
Notes on Q/A: 

Q19 - Solar storage rankings
One of the solar storage questions was supposed to be a ranked number question. People often answered this question improperly, in part due to the translation from digital to paper. The digital version had logic fail-safes to make sure people answered correctly while the paper version did not. Instead of ranking all three options together with a unique number from 1-3 as instructed, they used it more like a Likert scale and ranked each option individually from 1-3. This means that, while still somewhat useful to get a general sense of their preferences, this question (Q19) is neither consistently quantifiable no statistically reliable, due to the high number of non-standard responses. 

Q4 - What is the size of your solar PV system? (in kW)
This question required a great deal of quality control measures. Respondents often gave answers in what appeared to be watts (W), not kilowatts (kW). Sometimes they indicated that they weren’t sure or gave answers that had to do with some other calculation instead. For those that appeared to simply answer in W instead of kW, we checked the size of the home and panels using Google earth. Where the size of the home and its installed panels appeared to be logical and reasonable, we made the adjustment to comply with kW readings. In the few cases where the quality questions about this field were unresolvable or illegible, given the responses on paper, the entry was left blank. 

Q8: Solar Installer 
When people indicated their solar installer, sometimes the information was incomplete, incorrectly entered, or simply blank. For the records where we did have responses, we went onto Google to search for each one in order to verify the following information about each installer: a) Correct spelling of company name; b) Solar Installer actually existed and operated within Arizona. This was important because some installer names are quite similar, sometimes only a few characters different. By accurately listing the installers, we may then be able to calculate which companies did the most installations in a particular area. This could then be compared to other demographic data for analysis. 

Q11 & Q12 - Open essay questions
We took measures to maintain confidentiality for respondents in both of these questions by removing data where respondents included personal information such as name, phone number, or email address. In the few instances where this occurred, such personal information was replaced with the generic text code “#NAME?”
 
File architecture

This data set is in a flat file saved in .csv format. It is named: “SH_Survey_Data”. The vast majority of the data was collected via paper surveys and input into the online Qualtrics survey portal. It was then exported as .csv files and imported in batches into a single database for easy viewing and analysis. Once the data was input, organized, anonymized (eg. removing personal information such as name and phone number or other contact information that respondents provided in the survey, even though this information was not requested) it was exported again to .csv format. 

Variable Description

Solar financing 
The primary variables of this study have to do with ownership of the solar panels (Q5) and financing models at the time of home sale (Q6). For the two types of solar ownership respondents indicated: 151 “leased” solar arrangements and 128 “owned” solar arrangements. Of the leased solar, 95 of respondents took over payments on the lease, while 54 of the leases were pre-paid before completion of the home sale. These prepaid leases represent perhaps the most important variable in this study, as this data had not been previously captured and analyzed in this way. Another important variable is whether or not a pre-paid lease was a stipulation before the sale of the home could occur (Q9). Of the sales involving solar leases, prepaid leases were required in 13, while 85 of respondents indicated it was not a stipulation and 39 said they did not know if it was a stipulation or not. 

Home financing 
The third most important variable for analysis here is the question asking what kind of financing the respondents used to purchase their homes (Q25). These financing models each have different requirements and restrictions as to how or even whether real estate appraisers may value solar when determining a fair market value for the home at the time of sale. The responses for the different types of loans are as follows: 137 Conventional, 33 FHA, 32 VA, 74 Cash, 4 Other. 

Demographics
The demographic questions ask about the respondent’s gender (Q14), age (Q13), household income (Q17), race/ethnicity (Q15), and education (Q16). There were 175 Male and 102 Female respondents. The mean average age of these respondents was 54 years old. The greatest number of responses for income (128 responses)  showed that these households made over $100,000 of annual income. The vast majority (239) self-identified as being white. As for education levels, 213 respondents reported having an associate degree or higher. 

Variables for Organization and analysis:
new_primary_key
This is the primary key through which this data may be related to other data sets. It replaces the Q1 Unique ID and is also populated with a random number set.  

Misc. Comments
Comments about nonstandard responses or why respondent was omitted. For instance, several respondents had solar hot water heaters only, not solar PV. This was recorded in this field and those records were excluded from this data set. In other examples, people wrote comments or expanded on answers in the margins of the survey. This was made note of in this field. 

Zip_code
This is the zip code in which the home is located. 

Q17 Income Range Holder
This is a quantitative field that represents the textual range which people chose. For instance, “<$20,000” = 10 in this numbered field. “$20,000-$30,000” = 20. “$30,000-$40,000” = 30, etc… It exists only for simplicity in being able to easily search for and quantify the results for this variable, since the respondents were offered a range rather than asked to indicate an exact amount. 

Q15_Other_TEXT_Demographics_Race_Ethnicity
The people who indicated “other” for race or ethnicity had the option to enter their multiple races or ethnicities here in this field.
